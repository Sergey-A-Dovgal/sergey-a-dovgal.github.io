## Research overview

Since 2016, I am doing [research](research.html) in the field of **Analytic
Combinatorics** and **Probability**.
In short, Analytic Combinatorics studies [generating
functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function) from the
perspective of [complex
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis).

### Two major applications of Analytic Combinatorics

[Generating
functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function)
allow you to enter the world of simplistic perfection and
they demonstrate an innocent mathematical beauty.
But they are also a powerful tool when
it comes to studying large random objects.

**Enumeration** allows to tell you *how many* objects of a given size do there
exist, and in a more general form, allows to access distributions of
parameters of many systems.

**Random generation** allows to generate an object from a given class uniformly
at random. In somewhat more casual terms, it can be referred to as "Monte-Carlo
experiments" and you can find a
huge number of
[applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications) on the web.

### Phase transitions

The term “[phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition)”
was mostly used by physicists, but can be also
applied to many combinatorial situations, when a small change of a certain
parameter results in a huge asymptotic change of some other parameter. The
original studies of the physical phase transitions, including
[Ising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) and
[Potts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potts_model)
models, considered graphs which formed certain regular lattices: from rectangular
ones to more complicated including maps on surfaces. Of close relation is the
[percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory)
which is sometimes called “the simplest model displaying a
phase transition”. 

The phase transition phenomenon in random **simple graphs** and *multigraphs*
has been thoroughly studied.  One of the current goals of our research group is
to give an equally thorough description for a rapidly growing research body of
random **directed** graphs.

### Random generation

Sampling words uniformly at random from non-ambiguous
[context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar)
gives a solid basis for more advanced [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications).
The principle of [Boltzmann
sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_sampler) can be most easily
illustrated using the example of Catalan binary trees, which are defined as
rooted binary trees. 
The method consists of taking the equation whose generation function
\\( T(z) = \sum\_{n \geq 0} T\_n z^n \\)
satisfies
\\[
    T(z) = z + z T^2(z),
\\]
fixing a positive value \\(z \in (0, 1/2) \\)
and making a Bernoulli choice \\( \Xi_z \\) such that
\\[
    \mathbb P( \Xi_z = 0)
    =
    \\dfrac{z}{z + z T^2(z)},
\\]
\\[
    \mathbb P( \Xi_z = 1)
    =
    \\dfrac{z T^2(z)}{z + z T^2(z)}.
\\]
If \\( \Xi\_z = 0 \\), the generation outputs a single node and stops, otherwise it recursively calls two Boltzmann samplers with a parameter \\( z \\) and outputs a tree constructed by linking two recursively generated trees.
By a careful choice of \\( z \\), this allows to generate large trees of
necessary size in quasilinear time.

We are currently [developing](software.html) a polynomial-time tuning framework which allows to design flexible Boltzmann samplers.
